### Email Configuration

For password reset functionality, configure email settings in `website/settings.py`:

EMAIL_HOST = "smtp.gmail.com"
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_HOST_USER = "your_email@gmail.com"
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = "your_app_password"
```

**Note**: For Gmail, you'll need to generate an App Password instead of using your regular password.

### Payment Gateway Configuration

Update the Khalti secret key in `website/ecomapp/views.py`:

```python
headers = {
    "Authorization": "your_khalti_secret_key"
}
```
